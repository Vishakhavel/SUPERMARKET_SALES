# SUPERMARKET SALES PREDICTION IN RSTUDIO.






## DESCRIPTION

This project focuses on different types of supermarkets that are in business in a variety of locations and looks to answer some questions regarding the chief contributors to the profits that are earned by these outlets. We intended to make the output of this project very simple to understand, by the shop owners and businessmen in the retail sector. We started off with an extensive exploration module that answers some of the basic questions required by a data analyst to process further. Once the inconsistencies in the dataset were highlighted, we went on to clean the data and impute the missing values. The project then focussed on visualizing the data, making it easier to understand. This was followed by the usage of machine learning algorithms for predicting the sales of a particular item in a supermarket outlet. Five models were used and even within these five, the code was tweaked to obtain the best possible predictions. The project ends with a comparison of the various algorithms employed and identification of the best model.

## Conclusion

This paper introduces MDA-HSI, a dual multidimensional deep network finetuned for the task of hyperspectral image classification. The main goal of the proposed model is to consider both the spectral and spatial joint representations and interdependencies during the classification process while keeping the computational complexities minimal. We achieve this through two unique approaches. The first approach follows a hierarchical 3D 2D flow where the spectral spatial features are accounted for while an abstract level spatial 2D CNN completes the hierarchy reducing dimensionality. The second approach employs a modified 3D CNN that produces overlapping 3D feature patches over several contiguous bands processed under a three dimensional kernel function to obtain spectral inferences. The overall prediction is made as an weighted ensemble of the two models, which provides a well
defined approach taking all inherent information into consideration for the classification process. The MDA-HSI was tested upon benchmark datasets with existent deep methods which are currently in practice. The MDA-HIS proved efficient both in terms of average accuracy and Kappa score upon evaluation. Future work in this direction can look into the possibilities of self learning ensembles and improving classification strength through data augmentation.
